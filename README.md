The data set we chose is about medical insurance cost across each region of the United States. With this analytics project we hope to find whether certain groups in this data get charged more for their medical expenses due to factors like age, sex, BMI, number of children, their region and if they are a non smoker or smoker. We are interested in this topic because we are genuinely interested in the whether some groups suffer worse medical expenses on average than others. Some questions we look to answer: What ages have the highest medical expenses? Is there correlation between the medical expenses and the number of children one has had? And, do men with a high BMI face on average higher medical expenses than women with high BMI's? Regarding our dashboard, we plan to use the dataset's location data to make a heat map of the medical expenses by region. In addition to the heat map, we will be able to plot bar charts and histograms to display our data in interesting and meaningful ways.

Medical Cost Personal dataset is publicly available. It is used in Brett Lanz’ book, called Machine Learning with R. This dataset is obtained from GitHub. The Medical Cost Personal dataset contains 7 columns, which are age, sex, body mass index (BMI), children, smoker, region, and charges. According to GitHub, this dataset was created and last updated on February 20, 2018. This dataset was created to be used in teaching people how to create machine learning models. These models are meant to accurately predict medical insurance costs given a set of values. How this data was collected is not clear as it doesn't specify what medical records they came from. In order to find out more, we would have to obtain a full copy of Brett Lanz's book.
